Chapped skin? Dry Hair? Vitamin C to the rescue! Water From waterionizer.org
When you use a dirty towel to dry your skin after a shower, you only have activated its ability to smell better by making it wet. If you rinse the towel after drying your body, then a few of the dead cells wash out, and the rest of these cells remain on the towel. You can also supplement with a blow dryer to speed the drying of the remaining droplets. You will never have to use a bath towel after a shower again.
