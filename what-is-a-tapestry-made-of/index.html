<p>Having a lower needle number means that the needle will be thicker. The weft threads are usually wool or cotton but may include silk, gold, silver, or other alternatives. A tapestry is made by repeatedly weaving the horizontal (weft) threads over and under the vertical (warp) threads, then squishing (or tamping) those horizontal threads down so they are very close together, thus completely hiding the vertical threads from view. A tapestry is something that’s woven on a loom, whereas an embroidery is thread stitched onto a cloth background.</p>
