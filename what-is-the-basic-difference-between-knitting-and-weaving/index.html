<p>Weaving can be done on a power loom or hand loom or by several hand methods. Each intersection point between warp and weft is called weave point, which is the smallest basic unit of woven fabric. The strength of warp knitting fabrics may be increased by using yarns of strong fibers, yarns of balanced construction, and a high gage with strong free yarns.

For a beginner, it might take about 20 to 25 hours to create a cardigan with a simple design. While needle knitting the knitter keeps the tension of the stitches. While the woven fabric is produced on a loom by the interlacement of warp and weft yarn, knit fabric is made by the interlooping of yarn by means of the needle.</p>

A combination of yarns of different fibers, or different types of yarns ( simple, ply, complex), and space between loops affects the strength of the fabric. Additionally, weaved fabrics may be in grey, striped, or colored form. Basic difference between fibre, yarn and fabric by definition is:</p>

One of the most notable differences in the weaving vs knitting yarn discussion is that the sizing is so completely different. The quick and dirty version of weaving yarn sizes is that weaving yarn sizes are categorized by fractions where the top of the fraction is the size and the bottom is the number of plies (think 8/4 cotton). A weaving is done with machine while knitting is done with hand only.</p>
